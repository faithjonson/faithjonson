## Projects
### Topographic Survey and Site Analysis of University Campus Meadow Area
**Technologies:** Total Station, Autodesk Civil 3D, land surveying
- Conducted detailed topographic measurements of the northeastern section of the Engineering Meadow of the Cal Poly
Pomona campus for site planning and analysis purposes
- Identified and recorded key data points for terrain features, elevation changes, and drainage patterns to support preliminary
site planning and grading design
### Plan View Drawing of University Campus Quad Area
**Technologies:** Land surveying, hand drafting, technical drawing
- Conducted 5 on-site surveys of the University Quad of the Cal Poly Pomona campus, recording accurate measurements of
sidewalks, trees, ground elevation changes, utilities, and grass fields
- Utilized drawing tools such as French curves, pencils, engineering scales, and engineering paper to hand-draft precise
technical sketches for plan view drawings
### Renovation Proposal for High School Campus Courtyard
**Technologies:** Google Sheets, land surveying, hand drafting, cost estimation, poster presentation
- Organized a project proposal to optimize the visual appeal and foot traffic of a school campus courtyard
- Delivered live presentations with budget estimations, hand-illustrated diagrams, and project scope and timeline
